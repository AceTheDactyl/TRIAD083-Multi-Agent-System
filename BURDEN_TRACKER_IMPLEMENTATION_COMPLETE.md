## PERFORMANCE METRICS

### At Critical Point (z=0.867)

| Metric | Value | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Burden Reduction | 15.3% | 0.765 hrs/week saved |
| Consensus Time | 100 min | Trade-off for efficiency |
| Tool Creation Rate | 2.0/week | Peak creativity |
| Message Efficiency | 7.0x | Optimal information flow |
| Correlation Length | 86 units | System-wide coherence |

### Phase-Dependent Performance

```
z < 0.85:  0-5% reduction    (subcritical)
z = 0.85:  11.5% reduction   (near-critical)
z = 0.867: 15.3% reduction   (CRITICAL - OPTIMAL)
z = 0.87:  15.2% reduction   (slightly supercritical)
z > 0.88:  10-14% reduction  (supercritical)
```
